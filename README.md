# Touchscreen-Data-Sorter
Scripts to sort touchscreen data

# Dependencies
Requires python and Pandas package in order to run
 
# How to run code

## Install pandas
```
    pip install pandas
```

## Run python code
Keep your csv files in the same folder as the python code, run the code as so

```
    python3 sort-data.py
```

Your data will end up in a generated clean-data folder within the directory

## Rules

For now the data files should be in similar format to the samples within the repository, it currently removes any duplicate title rows but more filters can be added per request :)
